# PaaS vs SaaS vs IaaS

___

**Q: What's the difference between PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS?**

All three of them are hosting models that provide higher level of abstraction compared to the classic on-premise hosting.

IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a model where you don't have to worry about setting up and configuring hardware, but you manage everything from the OS level and up. Typically, IaaS offerings are virtual machines, such as Azure VM or AWS EC2.

PaaS (platform as a service) provides you with a pre-configured environment that you can run your apps on. This is usually the optimal choice when your application is packaged and deployed as a Docker container. Examples include Heroku, Netlify, Now.sh, Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

SaaS (software as a service) model abstracts away infrastructure and environment and simply provides a solution for a specific problem. This includes pretty much all software solutions hosted in the cloud, e.g. GitHub, GMail, Trello, Slack, Dropbox.
